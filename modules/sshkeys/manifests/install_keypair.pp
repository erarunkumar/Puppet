# sshkeys::install_keypair
# ========================
# Download a public/private SSH keypair from the Puppet Master and copy them to
# the `~/.ssh` directory for the specified user.
#
# Parameters
# ==========
# [*title*]
#   identify the key to copy from the puppet master to the local machine. Must
#   be in the form `user@host`.  As well as specifying the keypair to copy from
#   the Puppet Master, the title also denotes the local system user to install
#   the keys for
# [*source*]
#   File on the Puppet Master to source the private key from.  The filename of
#   the public key will be computed by appending `.pub` to this string.  This
#   is normally derived fully from the sshkeys::params class and the resource
#   title so is not normally needed
# [*ssh_dir*]
#   Override the default SSH directory of `/home/$user/.ssh`
